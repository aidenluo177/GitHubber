The `Tweak` clause allows fine-tuning the `NSFetchRequest` for a fetch or query.

Sample usage:

    let employees = transaction.fetchAll(
        From(MyPersonEntity),
        Tweak { (fetchRequest) -> Void in
            fetchRequest.includesPendingChanges = false
            fetchRequest.fetchLimit = 5
        }
    )
